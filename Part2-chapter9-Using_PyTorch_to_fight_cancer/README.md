# Deep-learning-with-pytorch
* Breaking a large problem into smaller,easier ones
* Exploring the constraints of an intricate deep learning problem,and deciding on a structure
  and approach
* Downloading the training data
* Our approach to detecting cancerous nodules will have five rough steps: data loading,segmentation,
  grouping,classification, and nodule analysis and diagnosis.
